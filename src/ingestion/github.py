"""GitHub data acquisition for the ingestion pipeline.

The flow is deliberately flat: ``make_session`` builds an ``httpx.Client``,
``_request`` performs one GET and turns failures into ``GitHubError``,
``_paginate`` walks GitHub's ``Link`` headers, and each ``fetch_*`` function
turns raw pages into validated models.

Every public function takes the session as its first argument, so tests pass an
``httpx.Client`` backed by ``httpx.MockTransport`` and exercise this module for
real without touching the network.

Retrying transient failures
---------------------------

``_request`` retries in the request layer, three attempts with a short
exponential backoff, and only for failures that a second attempt could plausibly
fix: a 5xx, or a connection or read timeout where no response arrived at all.

Everything else raises on the first attempt. A 4xx is a statement about the
request and will say the same thing again. An auth failure never becomes valid
by asking twice. **A rate limit is never slept off here** — waiting out a
primary GitHub limit can block for an hour, so it propagates carrying its reset
time and the run's owner decides.

This retries at the level of one HTTP request, so a paginated walk resumes at
the page that failed instead of restarting from the first. An earlier version
retried caller-side around whole fetches, which could not do that.

    a response that arrived and could not be parsed will not parse on the

    This type exists because the absence of a status code means two different

    none. A test asserted that permanence — so the suite was not silent about
