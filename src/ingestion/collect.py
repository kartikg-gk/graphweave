"""Resilient collection across many pull requests.

This sits above the client. The client now retries a transient failure inside
one request — see ``github._request`` — and this decides what the run does when
that has already been tried and still failed. Retrying is not repeated here;
doing both would give one enrichment call nine attempts instead of three.

**Enrichment degrades per item; do not make it abort the run.** Aborting an
entire fetch because one pull request's enrichment call failed loses the other
forty-nine pull requests, the issues, and the commits — a whole ingest thrown
away for one missing review list. So a failed item is dropped and the walk
continues, and the count of what was lost travels with the graph so a partial
result is never mistaken for a complete one.

**A rate limit is the exception, and it propagates.** Degrading per item is
right for a failure that is a property of one item — a malformed payload, a
call that timed out after its retries. A rate limit is a property of the
*session*: once it is hit, every remaining call fails for the same reason, so
treating it per item spends the rest of the walk confirming that and then
writes a store missing every edge for every pull request after the limit, with
an exit code of zero.

The counter cannot rescue that. It records how many items were lost and never
which, so nothing downstream can distinguish an issue that was never resolved
from one whose resolving pull request was never fetched. Surviving a failure
and recording enough to recover from it are different features, and the first
without the second is silent incompleteness.

So a rate limit aborts and the run exits non-zero. Loud and complete-or-nothing
beats quiet and short.
